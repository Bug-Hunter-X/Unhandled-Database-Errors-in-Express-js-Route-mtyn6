# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling during database interactions. The `bug.js` file shows an Express route that fetches user data from a database but lacks proper error handling.  This can lead to server crashes or unexpected responses to the client if the database query fails.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, demonstrates best practices for handling potential errors, ensuring robustness and providing informative error messages to clients.
